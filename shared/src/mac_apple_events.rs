/// macOS: handle the "open application" Apple Event Finder sends when the
/// user double-clicks the .app bundle.
///
/// When the persistent `--daemon` process is already running, Launch
/// Services treats it as the checked-in instance of the bundle and routes a
/// plain double-click to *it* (as `kAEOpenApplication` / `kAEReopenApplication`)
/// instead of spawning a fresh process. The daemon has no window/menu bar
/// (`NSApplicationActivationPolicyAccessory`, or on the receiver no
/// `NSApplication` at all) so it can't visibly respond, and Finder/Dock
/// eventually reports "Application Not Responding" while waiting for an
/// acknowledgement that never produces a UI.
///
/// The fix: when the daemon receives this event, spawn a brand-new instance
/// of the current executable with no arguments. That fresh process is not
/// the checked-in bundle instance, so it takes the normal
/// `is_double_clicked()` -> GUI branch and shows the status window.
